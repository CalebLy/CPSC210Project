# Frankenstein Adapation

## What will the application do?
This application will be a game. It will be an adaptation to Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*.
I plan for the application to present different stories and gameplays for different characters of *Frankenstein*.
## Who will use it?
The ones who will play the game are those who are interested in games and/or literature such as *Frankenstein*.
## Why is this project of interest to you?
This project will be my first attempt at creating a game through code, which has been an interest of mine.
Furthermore, I plan to further develop the game to submit as my English final project which asks for a
creative adaptation of *Frankenstein*
